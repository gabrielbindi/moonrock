This is a school-project form the HTL-Bulme related to project management. 
We have to code a game in Python and manage it. 
My game is called "Moonrock", a Space-Invaders-Like videogame, where you 
fly a Spaceship that must shoot and destroy enemies.
The project focuses on both technical implementation and project management principles. 
Includes planning tast distribution and documentation.
